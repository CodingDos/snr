# OMIG AUDIT PROTOCOL - OPWDD IRA RESIDENTIAL HABILITATION

**FOR SERVICE DATES 7/01/2014 - 6/30/2018**  
**REVISED September 17, 2021**

## Disclaimer

Audit protocols assist the Medicaid provider community in developing programs to evaluate compliance with Medicaid requirements under federal and state statutory and regulatory law. Audit protocols are intended solely as guidance in this effort. This guidance does not constitute rulemaking by the New York State Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) and may not be relied on to create a substantive or procedural right or benefit enforceable, at law or in equity, by any person. Furthermore, nothing in the audit protocols alters any statutory or regulatory requirement and the absence of any statutory or regulatory requirement from a protocol does not preclude OMIG from enforcing the requirement. In the event of a conflict between statements in the protocols and either statutory or regulatory requirements, the requirements of the statutes and regulations govern.

A Medicaid provider's legal obligations are determined by the applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory law. Audit protocols do not encompass all the current requirements for payment of Medicaid claims for a particular category of service or provider type and, therefore, are not a substitute for a review of the statutory and regulatory law. OMIG cannot provide individual advice or counseling, whether medical, legal, or otherwise. If you are seeking specific advice or counseling, you should contact an attorney, a licensed practitioner or professional, a social services agency representative, or an organization in your local community.

Audit protocols are applied to a specific provider type or category of service in the course of an audit and involve OMIG's application of articulated Medicaid agency policy and the exercise of agency discretion. Audit protocols are used as a guide in the course of an audit to evaluate a provider's compliance with Medicaid requirements and to determine the propriety of Medicaid expended funds. In this effort, OMIG will review and consider any relevant contemporaneous documentation maintained and available in the provider's records to substantiate a claim.

OMIG, consistent with state and federal law, can pursue civil and administrative enforcement actions against any individual or entity that engages in fraud, abuse, or illegal or improper acts or unacceptable practices perpetrated within the medical assistance program. Furthermore, audit protocols do not limit or diminish OMIG's authority to recover improperly expended Medicaid funds and OMIG may amend audit protocols as necessary to address identified issues of non-compliance. Additional reasons for amending protocols include, but are not limited to, responding to a hearing decision, litigation decision, or statutory or regulatory change.

### 13. Missing Documentation of Presence

**OMIG Audit Criteria**: The unit of service for supervised IRA residential habilitation services is daily. The provider must document the day present in the IRA by denoting lodging.

A Retainer/Medical Leave Day is a day during which an individual is on medical leave from the IRA or associated days where any other institutional or in-patient Medicaid payment is made for providing services to the individual. A Therapeutic/Non-Medical Leave Day is a day when the individual is away from the supervised residence and is not receiving services from paid residential habilitation staff.

The claim will be disallowed in the absence of documentation to indicate the correct presence of the individual for either a service day, retainer/medical leave day, or therapeutic leave day.

### 14. Missing Documentation of Residential Habilitation Service (Per Diem)

The claim will be disallowed if another Medicaid–funded residential or in-patient service was provided on that day.

Note: Services provided on a day of hospital admission may not be counted; however, the day of hospital discharge can be counted so long as eligible services were provided and documented.
