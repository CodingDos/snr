# OPWDD AUDIT PROTOCOL - COMMUNITY HABILITATION SERVICES

## Introduction

Effective January 1, 2020

Audit protocols assist the Medicaid provider community in developing programs to evaluate compliance with Medicaid requirements under federal and state statutory and regulatory law, and administrative procedures issued by the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD). The protocols listed are intended solely as guidance in this effort. This guidance does not constitute rulemaking by OPWDD and may not be relied on to create a substantive or procedural right or benefit enforceable, at law or in equity, by any person. Furthermore, nothing in the protocols alters any statutory, regulatory or administrative requirement and the absence of any statutory, regulatory or administrative citation from a protocol does not preclude OPWDD from enforcing a statutory, regulatory or administrative requirement. In the event of a conflict between statements in the protocols and statutory, regulatory or administrative requirements; the requirements of the statutes, regulations and administrative procedures govern.

A Medicaid provider's legal obligations are determined by the applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory law. Audit protocols do not encompass all the current requirements for payment of Medicaid claims for a particular category of service or provider type and therefore are not a substitute for a review of the statutory and regulatory law or administrative procedures.

Audit protocols are applied to a specific provider or category of service(s) in the course of an audit and involve OPWDD's application of articulated Medicaid agency policy and the exercise of agency discretion. Audit protocols are used as a guide in the course of an audit to evaluate a provider's compliance with Medicaid requirements and to determine the propriety of Medicaid expended funds. In this effort, OPWDD will review and consider any relevant contemporaneous documentation maintained and available in the provider's records to substantiate a claim.

New York State, consistent with state and federal law, can pursue civil and administrative enforcement actions against any individual or entity that engages in fraud, abuse, or illegal or improper acts or unacceptable practices perpetrated within the medical assistance program. Furthermore, audit protocols do not limit or diminish OPWDD's authority to recover improperly expended Medicaid funds and OPWDD may amend audit protocols as necessary to address identified issues of non-compliance. Additional reasons for amending protocols include, but are not limited to, responding to a hearing decision, litigation decision, or statutory or regulatory change.

## Note

Per ADM 2018-06R, As of July 1, 2018, individuals new to the OPWDD system (i.e., on or after July 1, 2018), will have Life plans developed and finalized in accordance with the CCO/HH Manual. Finalized Life Plans for newly enrolled CCO members (i.e., members enrolled after 10/1/2018) are due no later than 90 days after CCO enrollment or HCBS waiver enrollment, whichever comes first.

Per ADM 2018-06R, For Life Plans finalized on or before December 31, 2019 (i.e., the transition period), OPWDD is suspending service documentation requirements for documenting the Waiver service name, frequency, duration, and effective date in the Life Plan. Instead, only the name of the service provider and the service name must be identified in the Life Plan.

Service providers are responsible for reviewing the finalized, acknowledged and agreed to Life Plan. Providers may occasionally find inaccuracies in the finalized, acknowledged and agreed to Life Plan. Providers should demonstrate due diligence in working with the Care Manager, CCOs, OPWDD and/or others to correct the Life Plan as soon as possible. Service providers should document their timely efforts to correct any errors in the Life Plan. Examples of this documentation may include notes in the individual's monthly summary, e-mails, phone calls, etc.

All Life Plans created or amended after the transition period must comply with all regulatory and policy standards.

Per ADM 2018-09R, As of March 1, 2020, At the time of transition to the Life Plan, Habilitation Plans must transition to Staff Action Plans. All individuals transitioning from an ISP to a Life Plan who receive habilitation services must have a staff Action Plan no later than March 1, 2020.
