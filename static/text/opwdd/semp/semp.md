**OPWDD AUDIT PROTOCOL  ![](Aspose.Words.94dd3403-eedd-4949-bb7f-0a9b13ca63a7.001.png)**

Audit protocols assist the Medicaid provider community in developing programs to evaluate compliance with Medicaid requirements under federal and state statutory and regulatory law, and administrative procedures issued by the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD).  The protocols listed are intended solely as guidance in this effort. This guidance does not constitute rulemaking by OPWDD and may not be relied on to create a substantive or procedural right or benefit enforceable, at law or in equity, by any  person.  Furthermore,  nothing  in  the  protocols  alters  any  statutory,  regulatory  or  administrative requirement and the absence of any statutory, regulatory or administrative citation from a protocol does not preclude OPWDD from enforcing a statutory, regulatory or administrative requirement. In the event of  a conflict between statements in the protocols and statutory, regulatory or administrative requirements; the requirements of the statutes, regulations and administrative procedures govern. 

A Medicaid provider’s legal obligations are determined by the applicable federal and state statutory  and regulatory law. Audit protocols do not encompass all the current requirements for payment of  Medicaid claims for a particular category of service or provider type and therefore are not a substitute for a review of the statutory and regulatory law or administrative procedures. 

Audit protocols are applied to a specific provider or category of service(s) in the course of an audit and involve OPWDD’s application of articulated Medicaid agency policy and the exercise of agency discretion. Audit protocols are used as a guide in the course of an audit to evaluate a provider’s compliance with Medicaid requirements and to determine the propriety of Medicaid expended funds. In this effort, OPWDD will review  and  consider  any  relevant  contemporaneous  documentation  maintained  and  available  in  the provider’s records to substantiate a claim. 

New York State, consistent with state and federal law, can pursue civil and administrative enforcement actions  against  any  individual  or  entity  that  engages  in  fraud,  abuse,  or  illegal  or  improper  acts  or unacceptable practices perpetrated within the medical assistance program. Furthermore, audit protocols do not limit or diminish OPWDD’s authority to recover improperly expended Medicaid funds and OPWDD may amend audit protocols as necessary to address identified issues of non-compliance. Additional reasons for amending protocols include, but are not limited to, responding to a hearing decision, litigation decision, or statutory or regulatory change. 

**Note:**  

Per ADM 2018-06R, As of July 1, 2018, individuals new to the OPWDD system (i.e., on or after July 1, 2018), will have Life plans developed and finalized in accordance with the CCO/HH Manual. Finalized Life Plans for newly enrolled CCO members (i.e., members enrolled after 10/1/2018) are due no later than 90 days after CCO enrollment or HCBS waiver enrollment, whichever comes first. 

Per ADM 2018-06R, For Life Plans finalized on or before December 31, 2019 (i.e., the transition period), OPWDD is suspending service documentation requirements for documenting the Waiver service name, frequency, duration, and effective date in the Life Plan. Instead, only the name of the service provider and the service name must be identified in the Life Plan.  

Service  providers  are responsible  for reviewing  the finalized,  acknowledged  and  agreed to  Life  Plan.  Providers may occasionally find inaccuracies in the finalized, acknowledged and agreed to Life Plan.  ![ref1] Providers should demonstrate due diligence in working with the Care Manager, CCOs, OPWDD and/or others to correct the Life Plan as soon as possible.  Service providers should document their timely efforts to correct any errors in the Life Plan.  Examples of this documentation may include notes in the individual’s monthly summary, e-mails, phone calls, etc. 

All Life Plans created or amended after the transition period must comply with all regulatory and policy standards. 

Per ADM 2018-09R, As of March 1, 2020, At the time of transition to the Life Plan, Habilitation Plans must transition to Staff Action Plans. All individuals transitioning from an ISP to a Life Plan who receive habilitation services must have a staff Action Plan no later than March 1, 2020. ![ref1]

|**19.** |**Units of Service Billed Exceed Units of Service Documented** |
| - | - |
|**OPWDD Audit Criteria** |The claim will be disallowed if the number of 15-minute increments billed exceeded the number of 15-minute increments documented for SEMP services. Billing unit errors will be disallowed to the extent of the difference between the amount claimed and actual. |



||<p>The unit of service for SEMP is an hour. Services are billed in 15-minute increments (units), with a full 15 minutes of service required to bill a single increment (i.e., there is no “rounding up”). When there is a break in the service delivery during a single day, the service provider must combine, for billing purposes, the durations of the continuous periods/sessions of each specific type of service provision for billing purposes (e.g., the durations of each individual session within a day must be combined, but a combination of individual and group sessions provided in the same day must not be combined). </p><p>Billable service time. Billable service time for Intensive and Extended SEMP is:  </p><p>i. time  when  the  service  provider  is  providing  SEMP  in  accordance  with  the individual's supported employment service delivery plan; and  </p><p>ii. time  when  service  provider  is  developing  the  supported  employment  service delivery plan. </p><p>Restrictions on billable service time.  </p><p>i. Time spent receiving another Medicaid service must not be counted toward SEMP service time in instances when the Medicaid service is received simultaneously with one or more allowable SEMP activities (see 14 NYCRR  635-10.4(j)) provided directly  to  the  individual.  An  exception  is  the  provision  of  Medicaid  Service Coordination, which may be received simultaneously with all allowable SEMP activities.  </p><p>ii. (ii) If an individual is in the Intensive phase of SEMP, the individual is not eligible to receive the Pathway to Employment service because allowable activities in Intensive SEMP and the Pathway to Employment service are the same. </p>|
