# OPWDD AUDIT PROTOCOL - DAILY RESIDENTIAL HABILITATION SERVICES PROVIDED IN SUPERVISED INDIVIDUALIZED RESIDENTIAL ALTERNATIVES AND COMMUNITY RESIDENCES

**Effective July 1, 2014**

## Introduction

Audit protocols assist the Medicaid provider community in developing programs to evaluate compliance with Medicaid requirements under federal and state statutory and regulatory law, and administrative procedures issued by the New York State Office for People With Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD). The protocols listed are intended solely as guidance in this effort. This guidance does not constitute rulemaking by OPWDD and may not be relied on to create a substantive or procedural right or benefit enforceable, at law or in equity, by any person. Furthermore, nothing in the protocols alters any statutory, regulatory or administrative requirement and the absence of any statutory, regulatory or administrative citation from a protocol does not preclude OPWDD from enforcing a statutory, regulatory or administrative requirement. In the event of a conflict between statements in the protocols and statutory, regulatory or administrative requirements; the requirements of the statutes, regulations and administrative procedures govern.

A Medicaid provider's legal obligations are determined by the applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory law. Audit protocols do not encompass all the current requirements for payment of Medicaid claims for a particular category of service or provider type and therefore are not a substitute for a review of the statutory and regulatory law or administrative procedures.

Audit protocols are applied to a specific provider or category of service(s) in the course of an audit and involve OPWDD's application of articulated Medicaid agency policy and the exercise of agency discretion. Audit protocols are used as a guide in the course of an audit to evaluate a provider's compliance with Medicaid requirements and to determine the propriety of Medicaid expended funds. In this effort, OPWDD will review and consider any relevant contemporaneous documentation maintained and available in the provider's records to substantiate a claim.

New York State, consistent with state and federal law, can pursue civil and administrative enforcement actions against any individual or entity that engages in fraud, abuse, or illegal or improper acts or unacceptable practices perpetrated within the medical assistance program. Furthermore, audit protocols do not limit or diminish OPWDD's authority to recover improperly expended Medicaid funds and OPWDD may amend audit protocols as necessary to address identified issues of non-compliance. Additional reasons for amending protocols include, but are not limited to, responding to a hearing decision, litigation decision, or statutory or regulatory change.
